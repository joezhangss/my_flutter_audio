# Multi-player audio

**This plugin is under development, this already being used in production. Just make sure you understand what's missing**

![Example running on Android](https://github.com/idofilus/flutter_audio/blob/master/doc/flutter_audio.gif?raw=true)


Flutter Audio which will both play and ~~record audio~~ _(upcoming feature)_.

_(after failed tries trying to work and combine few existing plugins, due the continues issues I had I decided to create this plugin)_

The aim of this plugin is really to give a solid solution for audio,
feel free to open issues with new requests or pull requests.
This is extremely important to have such a plugin that is very activate with updates.

And of course, performance.
Even thought this package is offering lots of features.
I really care about the performance, so I took a close care of it.

## Features
- Audio player with support to multiple players simultaneously
- Buffer updates on the player _(percent of the loading whether it's local or remote file)_
- Preload the audio
- ~~Audio Recorder~~ _(upcoming feature)_

I'll be adding soon more support, my goal is to make this plugin a complete solution.
